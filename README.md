A digital dichotomous for ID of Western North American Mushrooms.

This key will function much like the paper version of the same. The user will answer a series of yes or no questions, the answers to which will be used to determine the mushroom type. The framework of this key could be easily adapted to any other situation which would need a dichotomous key, e.g. plant or microbe identification.

The input data will be observed from a physical specimen and parsed into the program from user inputs. The user would be best prepared with a physical specimen, a spore print from this specimen, and a magnifying glass or dissection scope.
